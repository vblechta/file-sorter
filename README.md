# File sorter
Sorts files with names "something randomA - something randomB" into subdirs with names of "something randomA" part of filename.
Quickly written to help my friend Pavel ;-)

##How to use it
- check if you have python installed
- check or change folder path on line 3 of *organize_files.py* file
- run it using:
```
python3 organize_files.py
```
You can also generate test files, to test the file sorting.
```
python3 generate_files.py
```
